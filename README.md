# blackBox

Welcome to the blackBox!

The blackBox contains a set of competitive programming templates that i've written for use in contests (USACO, Codeforces, Leetcode, etc)

Here's a list of the data structures/algorithms I've implemented so far:

# 1. KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm
- Let string S be a string of size N and string s be a string of size M.
- KMP Algorithm will find all occurences of s in S in O(N+M) time assuming M <= N.
- The space complexity for KMP is O(M)
# 2. TBD
