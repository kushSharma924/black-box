# blackBox

Welcome to the blackBox!

The blackBox contains a set of competitive programming templates that I've written for use in contests (USACO, Codeforces, Leetcode, etc)

Here's a list of the data structures/algorithms I've implemented so far:

# 1. KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm
- Let S be a string of size N and s be a string of size M (M <= N).
- KMP will find all occurences of s in S and store them in a vector v.
- The time complexity for KMP is O(N+M).
- The space complexity for KMP is O(M).
# 2. TBD
